## What is Neovim?

Neovim is a text editor that runs in the terminal, an enhanced version of Vim designed to improve user experience and ease of maintenance. It is very, very fast. Many people, including myself, say **_"Once you try Neovim, there's no turning back."_**

It is a powerful text editor with many features, but don't worry, you don't need to know them all to use it. Over time, you'll learn them. Moreover, you can customize it to your liking with plugins, themes, etc.

To use Neovim, you first need to install it. You can learn how to do it in the following [link](https://www.neovim.io/). This will install Neovim completely clean, without any plugins or anything, just the editor. Configuring Neovim is a whole different world. However, you can choose to use [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), which is a Neovim configuration that comes with plugins, themes, etc. This way, you'll save a lot of configuration time and can go straight to using it. There are many other configurations, but I recommend `LazyVim` to start getting familiar. This is my Neovim configuration if you want to check it out: [My nvim setup](https://github.com/rxtsel/nvim).

You may feel a bit lost when using it, but don't worry, I'll teach you some basic commands to get you started.

## Neovim Modes

You should know that Neovim has different modes, which are:

- **Normal mode:** The default mode for navigating the document, copying, pasting, cutting, etc.
- **Insert mode:** The mode for typing in the document.
- **Visual mode:** The mode for selecting text.
- **Comand mode:** The mode for executing commands.
- **Terminal Mode:** The mode for running terminal commands.

I have a plugin that shows me the mode I'm in, but if you don't have it, you can see it in the bottom left corner; it will show you the mode you're in:
